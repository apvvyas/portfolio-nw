# How to Add Your Profile Photo

Follow these simple steps to add your photo to the portfolio:

## Step 1: Get Your Photo

1. Go to your Facebook profile: https://www.facebook.com/vyasapoorv
2. Click on your profile picture
3. Right-click and select "Save Image As..."
4. Save it with a simple name (e.g., `profile-photo.jpg`)

## Step 2: Add Photo to Portfolio

1. Copy your saved photo file to this folder:
   ```
   /Users/technoidentity/projects/apoorv-vyas-portfolio/
   ```

2. Rename it to `profile-photo.jpg` (or update the filename in `index.html` line 46)

## Step 3: View Your Updated Portfolio

Open `index.html` in your browser and you should see your photo!

## Troubleshooting

If the photo doesn't appear:
- Make sure the filename matches exactly (including the file extension)
- Check that the photo is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Try using a different image format (jpg, png, or webp all work)

## Alternative: Use a Different Filename

If you want to use a different filename:
1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find line 46: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" ...>`
3. Replace `profile-photo.jpg` with your actual filename
4. Save and refresh the browser

**Note**: The website will show a default user icon if no photo is found, so it will still work without a photo!
